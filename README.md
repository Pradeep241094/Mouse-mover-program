    pip3 install pyautogui

3. Run the Script

    Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved mouse_mover.py, and run the script:

    python3 mouse_mover.py


4. Customization:
    
    Movement Pattern: Adjust the mouse movement pattern by modifying the move_mouse function.

    Sleep Duration: Change the sleep duration between movements by modifying the values in the time.sleep calls.
